 Sure, let's break it down:

"I was given a task to create a responsive React website using react-bootstrap. This was my first full website project with bootstrap-react.

However, I'm facing a challenge â€“ the website works well only in full-screen mode. 'Responsive' means the website should look good and function well on different devices, like phones and tablets.

React-bootstrap provides helpful components for building responsive layouts. But I'm still figuring out how to make my website adapt to various screen sizes.

Think of it like making sure your website looks nice not just on a big computer screen but also on smaller phone screens.

I'm learning to tweak the design with react-bootstrap so that people can enjoy the website no matter if they're using a computer or a phone. It's about making things user-friendly for everyone!"
